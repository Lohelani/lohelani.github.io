    <p>Hi! </p>
        <p>My name is Lohelani, which translates in Hawaii to "to hear from heaven" or the translation which my parents prefer "to do heaven's bidding." I grew up on the island of O'ahu, and am part Native Hawaiian. My childhood was unique to say the least. I was homeschooled, and learned about how to forage and climb trees before I could read. I have 9 siblings, so all together there are 10 of us, five girls, and five boys. </p>

        <p2>Here's a photo of a frequently foraged fruit from my childhood, the strawberry guava.</p2>
